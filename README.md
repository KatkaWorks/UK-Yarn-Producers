##  Data Preparation Summary (18 October 2025)

The following steps were completed to prepare the dataset for analysis:

###  Data Cleaning
- Standardised region names using official postal naming.
- Trimmed extra spaces and checked consistency in key text fields.
- Verified required fields are populated and correctly formatted.

###  Data Normalisation
- Created `FiberTypes_Linked` and `Certifications_Linked` sheets to store multi-value fields in relational form.
- Ensured each entry links back to a valid producer via `producer_id`.

###  Data Validation
- Cross-checked that all linked `producer_id` values exist in the main `Producers` sheet.
- No missing or unmatched references remain.
- Multi-select values should be separated by commas.  
- Keep all data consistent to make it easier for analysis in SQL or Power BI.
