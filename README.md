# UK Yarn Producers

## Overview of British Wool

Did you know that British wool is not a single material, but a collection of many unique types, each with its own specific characteristics? The breed of sheep from which the wool comes plays a key role in its qualities. Each variety has a story to tell about its origin and offers different textures, colours and features that can have a significant impact on the outcome of your projects.

Some of the best-known types include fibres from Bluefaced Leicester, Masham, British wool, alpaca, merino, Romney, Derbyshire gritstone, Jacob, Black Welsh Mountain, Hebridean, and North of England Mule breeds.

Here, I focus on three producers from different regions of Great Britain:

- **Appleton's Wool Ltd**, based in **Buckinghamshire**, specialises in British crewel and tapestry wool, focusing on quality and consistency.
  
- **Baa Ram Ewe**, based in **Lancashire**, specialises in breed-specific, sustainably sourced British wool and works closely with local farmers, spinners, and dyers.

- **BareFaced Yarn**, based in **Northumberland**, blends Bluefaced Leicester wool with luxurious alpaca and also offers organic cotton in soft, natural colours.

By choosing wool from these producers, you are not only getting top-quality materials but also supporting local farmers and helping to preserve the tradition of British wool production.

##  Data Preparation Summary

The following steps were completed to prepare the dataset for analysis:

###  Data Cleaning
- Standardised region names using official postal naming.
- Trimmed extra spaces and checked consistency in key text fields.
- Verified required fields are populated and correctly formatted.

###  Data Normalisation
- Created `FiberTypes_Linked` and `Certifications_Linked` sheets to store multi-value fields in relational form.
- Ensured each entry links back to a valid producer via `producer_id`.

###  Data Validation
- Cross-checked that all linked `producer_id` values exist in the main `Producers` sheet.
- No missing or unmatched references remain.
- Multi-select values should be separated by commas.  
- Keep all data consistent to make it easier for analysis in SQL or Power BI.

## Data Import Workflow

To prepare my Excel data for analysis in SQL and Power BI, I followed this process:

1. **Excel source**  
   The dataset was originally stored in an Excel workbook containing multiple sheets (e.g., `Producers`, `Products`, `FiberTypes`, `Certifications`).

2. **CSV conversion**  
   Each sheet was individually exported to a `.csv` file. I ensured only one sheet was active when saving, to avoid exporting the entire workbook.

3. **Database setup in DBeaver**  
   - I used **DBeaver** with a local **SQLite** connection.  
   - For each `.csv` file, I imported the data into a new SQLite table using DBeaver’s import tool.  
   - I verified that column names matched the headers from the CSV files and ensured proper encoding (UTF-8).  
   - Table names correspond to the original sheet names for clarity and consistency.

4. **Verification**  
   After importing, I confirmed that:
   - All columns were correctly recognised (e.g., `fiber_composition`, `gauge`, `launch_year`).  
   - Table structures matched expectations.
   - Referential fields such as `producer_id` were consistent across tables.

This setup now allows me to:
- Run SQL queries to explore and validate the data.
- Connect the SQLite database to **Power BI** for data visualisation.
- Maintain a clean, reproducible workflow that’s easy to update as the dataset grows.
### **Process for Filtering and Exporting Data from SQL to CSV**


1. **Filtering 100% Wool Products in DBeaver**  
   In DBeaver, I used an SQL query to filter products made from **100% wool** in the `Products` table. The query I used is as follows:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT producer_name, product_name, fiber_composition  
   FROM Products
   WHERE fiber_composition LIKE '%100%';
   ```
     
2. **Exporting to CSV Format**
   After obtaining the desired results, I exported the filtered data into a CSV file, which I can later use for further analysis and visualisation in Power BI.
